# DimSplat - Prototype

This prototype was developed as part of the master's thesis titled 'DimSplat. Development of a Diminished Reality Prototype with Gaussian Splats for Mobile Augmented Reality Applications'. It represents the result of the development and was used for the results presented in the thesis.

With this prototype, diminished reality scenarios can be realized using Gaussian splatting. This prototype works on all WebXR-enabled devices. (For iOS devices, it is recommended to use the [XRBrowser](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xr-browser/id1588029989)). However, it should be noted that this is still just a prototype, and therefore, it cannot diminish any scenes but only selected ones.

The project also includes a Gaussian splatting library, which can be found at this link: [@jonascholz/gaussian-splatting on GitHub](https://github.com/jonascholz99/gaussian-splatting). This library is based on Dylan Ebert's `gsplat.js` framework ([gsplat.js on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/gsplat.js)) and has been fundamentally restructured for the purposes of this thesis.
